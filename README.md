Hi, my name is Aishat Safin.

This project is a "How to Learn" website.

This is my first project and I tried to make it interesting. It focuses on learning and memorization techniques. In it you can find interesting facts, short articles, links to literature, as well as entertaining videos.

This is a simple and informative site with the ability to follow links, with playback of video content. It uses HTML and CSS. There is also a simple animation based on CSS. It uses only a few fonts and colors. However, the site is tasteful, organic and friendly looking.
